Revision history for Perl extension C::Scan::Constants.

1.013
    - Fixed special case of test 02 so it passes wherever blueprint
      is installed.

1.012
    - Added Data::Flow to satisfy ModPerl::CScan prereqs.
    - Fixed copying of bundled ModPerl::CScan in Makefile.pl -- "cp -a"
      is not supported on many platforms, so using File::Copy::copy()
      in conjuntion with Perl builtin mkdir() instead.
    - Correct Pod syntax error (unbalanced =back on line 663).

1.011
    - Added contrib dir to MANIFEST

1.010
    - Adjusted suggested code snippet to have correct XS loading code

1.009
    - Adjusted documentation to properly represent version number

1.008
    - added ModPerl::CScan to this distro to avoid having to have
      the full mod_perl distro installed ahead of time
    - genericized and beefed up tests, including adding bundled .h files
    - updated author contact info throughout
    - insulated code from blueprint

0.04 - 1.007
    - arranged for constants to be forward-declared so they always
      behave as constants, instead of as barewords in some circumstances.
    - changed version to be tied to revision of .pm file.  This is
      not entirely precise but generally hits the mark.  If the
      version needs bumping at a later time due to a change somewhere
      else I'll figure out a workaround then.
    - migrated to ModPerl::CScan from C::Scan due to the fact that
      the latter fails on many .h files, whereas the former does not
    - fixed up constants to be properly mortalized


0.03
    - removed Readonly-related cruft since it's no longer used
    - added special Blueprint (proprietary build system software)
      tag to fix build-time non-warnings marked incorrectly as WARN

0.02
    - changed name to C::Scan::Constants (from original Foo::Constant)
    - extracted pertinent parts from Foo::Constant into callable functions
    - added tests for everything that is easy to test

0.01  Thu Jun  2 11:23:42 2005

		-n Foo::Constant
