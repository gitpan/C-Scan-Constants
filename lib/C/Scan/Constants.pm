You will need to add some code to your YourPkgName.pm and YourPkgName.xs
files in order to make use of the code that has just been autogenerated

If you've already added the code, just ignore this message.

Otherwise, do some cut-and-paste of the following snippets,
substituting "YourPkgName" with your actual module name
everywhere you see it in the snippets.

Then, simply "make" and test!  It's that easy.

=head1 NAME

C::Scan::Constants - Slurp constants from specified C header (.h) files

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to C::Scan::Constants version 1.018.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ## Intended for use in your module's Makefile.PL file, to
  ## add DWIMery to use of C constants within your module.

  use C::Scan::Constants;

  my @hdr_files = (
      "/path/to/first_header.h",
      "/path/to/second_header.h",
  );

  ## Slurp a list of constant information from C headers
  my @constants = extract_constants_from( @hdr_files );

  ## Create the C, XS, and pure-Perl machinery needed to
  ## provide automagical access to C constants at runtime.
  write_constants_module( "Your::Module", @constants );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an alternative to using the B<h2ph> command
to generate Perl header (.ph) files that are then subsequently
C<require>d by your module code.  When you need access to C
numeric and enumerated type constants,
especially in a dynamic source tree environment, there are times
when you'd like something a little more automagical and closely
tailored to what you actually need.  Now you have it, in this module.

C::Scan::Constants was born out of a recognition that ModPerl::CScan
and ExtUtils::Constant provide a wealth of capabilities in the
area of C code parsing and autogenerated XS access to C constants,
but that the actual mechanisms for harnessing them to do those
things were really rather opaque.  This module should help
take (most of) the mystery out of those activities.

Here's a brief overview of the module:

=over 4

=item *

Provides a function, L<"extract_constants_from()">, that extracts
a list of information relating to L<#define> constants and
L<#typedef enum> style constants found in a supplied list of
C header (.h) files.

=item *

Provides a function, L<"write_constants_module()">, that generates
three files:

        const-c.inc
        const-xs.inc
        lib/Your/ModuleName/Constants/C/Symbols.pm

that are ready to be dropped into your module's build machinery
to give your module runtime access to those constants.

=item *

Gives hints at C<perl Makefile.PL> time about the code you need
to add to files in your module's source tree to assure that
all the tracks line up at module build time.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

The following two subroutines are exported by default.

=head2 @blobs = extract_constants_from( @header_paths )

=over

Takes a list of C header (.h) files and returns a list
of constants information suitable for supplying as the NAME parameter
to ExtUtils::Constant.

Returns an array of constant name "blobs" suitable for feeding
into ExtUtils::Constant::WriteConstants() as the value of
the NAME parameter.

=back

=head2 write_constants_module( $pkg_name, @c_constants )

=over

Writes a Constants/C/Symbols.pm submodule into the
invoking Makefile.PL module's namespace.  Really just a value-added
wrapper around ExtUtils::Constant::WriteConstants().

No return value -- call for side-effects only.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

TBD.  I owe you a list of error and warning messages you might see
when invoking functions from C::Scan::Constants.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

TBD.  If/when populated, this section will describe
in detail how/where to add the
necessary extra code to wire in the autogenerated files to your
module.  It will also describe what you need in your Makefile.PL
to assure that the autogenerated stuff goes away at C<make clean>
time.

For the time being, write_constants_module() outputs to STDERR
a number of hints that should provide the needed answers to these
types of questions.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

For the program proper:

=over 4

Carp, Data::Flow, ExtUtils::Constants,
ModPerl::CScan, C::Scan, File::Temp, File::Copy,
File::Spec, File::Path, Exporter

=back

Additional modules needed for tests (over and above Test::More):

=over 4

Scalar::Util, List::MoreUtils, Cwd

=head1 COMPATIBILITY NOTES

This version of C::Scan::Constants is known to work with version
of ExtUtil::Constants versions 0.14 - 0.16.  It may not work
properly with earlier or later versions.  I welcome your comments
and patches to assure continued compatibility going forward.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The amount of code you are currently required to add to your module
to make use of the files C::Scan::Constants generates seems rather
too much.  It would be highly useful to provide a more streamlined
usage, or to provide scripts that would assist you in inserting the
needed code into your module.

Also, the tests are incomplete.  The runtime usability of constants
generated by the module is not tested at all.  I need to set up some
tests that actually create a new module, invoke the C::Scan::Constants
functionality, and then do a

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

regimen on that module in order to accomplish this.   That's pretty
tricky, so I haven't tackled it yet.

Finally (well probably not), it would be nice to be able to specify
whether B<cpp> should "follow" C<#include> statements in C header files.
Sometimes, that's what you really want.  This version of
C::Scan::Constants suppresses all such "following" behavior.

Other than that, there are no known bugs in this module.

Please report problems to Philip Monsen (philip.monsen@gmail.com).
Patches are especially welcome.
